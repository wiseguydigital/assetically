# Assetically

A package for [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) using [Assetic](https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic), [Lessphp](https://github.com/leafo/lessphp) and [CssMin](https://github.com/natxet/CssMin) to help with development and production (CDN) asset management.

This is still a work in progress and has not been fully documented yet but works nonetheless. Use at your own risk ;)
